auto_check_update : true
// Check for the new update from GitHub every time the world starts
// Default is true

auto_update : false

Tree Placer & World Gen
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tree_placer_auto_speed : true
// Enable auto speed for the tree placer. Turn this ON will use specific speed value, not from config value. The speed will automatic change based from game delay per second. Slower when high delay, faster when low delay.
// Default is true

// How fast place a tree in tick. Set to 0 to temporary pause the tick.
// Default is 1

tree_placer_process_limit : 100

// Default is 50

tree_location : true
// This is for store some tree data and for some features. Disable this will remove tree location from world gen. Can reduce entity lag, but you will don't know what is the file name of that tree, also some features will not work such as safe zones, tree distancing and RT dynamic.
// Default is true

world_gen_roots : true
// Enable tree roots in world gen. Note that disable this feature will not affect to some trees and nature stuffs because roots is important part for them.

// Set size of the detector, for all detectors at 8 directions. Set to 0 to disable this feature.
// Default is 5

surface_smoothness_detection_height : 5
// Set height of the detector, this value for each up and down. If the detector detects that the surface is rough than this height, it will cancel the tree.
// Default is 5

world_height_limit : 1
// Set highest Y limit, to prevent trees from placing if they higher than world hight to protect them from head cut-off. Set to 1 for auto value between 256 to 4000, run a test every time the world start. Set to 0 for no limit.
// Default is 1

// How many process for trees to run RT dynamic system. Set to 0 for one time process.
// Default is 100

rt_dynamic_simulation : 50
// Simulate fake tree to slowdown tree process. For example, when I set tree speed for 100 trees. But it's only 1 tree in the area, it will drop and regrow leaves very fast because that's the speed for 100 trees. Set this config will simulate fake tree locations and make that 1 tree slowdown it process like it's 99 trees around it.
// Default is 50

season_detector : true
// Use an area from world spawn to detect current season from Serene Seasons mod
// Default is true

leaves_litter : true
// Create leaves block on the ground. Disable leaves drop animation to make this instantly create leaves little instead of create when leaves drop animation touch the ground, also disable that will use full chance to be leaves litter.
