- This is developer tool to generate a tree file from preset, it will use my void dimension to generate trees so it not affect to normal world.
- First you need file name and directory of it, putting it and then use command [ /THT auto_gen start <loop> ]
- Warning! this dimension highest Y is 400 so be careful about world height/lower cut the trees. You can change posY option for the position of tree.
- Set generate speed too high is not recommended, since it can causes floating parts when gnerate in worldgen as a dead tree.
- Also please don't close the world while generating trees, it may cause double trees generate at the same place, which can make the file go wrong.
